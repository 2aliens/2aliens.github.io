## Tips
"ABC (Always Be Coding). The more you code, the better you’ll get — it’s that simple. By coding, you’re practicing. But the best practice is focused practice. Have goals in mind, explore new areas, and challenge yourself. Over time, you should develop a portfolio of both unfinished and finished projects. GitHub is a great place to put this portfolio on display, but just having an eclectic body of work is huge." (from https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2#.4heg8zvm4)
"Improve and maintain, over time
Once the rust is gone, and you’re fully prepped, it is dead easy to keep your CS and interview skills sharp: solve one coding question per day. I’ve been doing this for the past 3 years or so, and I’ve realized the following benefits:
I’m never out of practice
It helps flex mental muscles and improve critical thinking, the same way solving crossword puzzles, brain teasers or playing a game of chess might." (from https://medium.com/@nick.ciubotariu/ace-the-coding-interview-every-time-d169ce1fd3fc)
