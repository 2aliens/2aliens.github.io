<h1>Map to CS</h1>
<p>The best way to start a journey is following a map. Or getting lost on every step on the way.
This is a map of content, a <em>hitchhiker's guide</em> to Computer Science. We're going from Coding
to Machine Learning in a creative and artistic way. In the end of this journey, you'll accumulate
enough knowledge to call you a software engineer, or a ML data scientist.</p>
<p>Every link will bring you to one YouTube video explaining the topic in a concise and fun way we
were able to create.</p>
